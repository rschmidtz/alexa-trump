# Privacy Statement

The authorization server doesn't retain your personal details of the user and,
as a result of using OAuth, never sees your password to Twitter.

Based on how the Twitter app is configured, the server will not request you for
write access to your timeline, either. While it will have read access, no
operations are implemented for reading your timeline or the timeline of your
followers...with the exception of @realDonaldTrump
